The cable has two different connectors at each end: one is a 3.5mm jack, similar to the ones used for audio devices, and the other is an RS232 (Serial) DB9 connector, which is a standard interface for serial communication. By using the ExLink connector, you can communicate with the TV using a serial Communications Software, such as Hyperterminal or Putty, which are available for Windows or Linux operating systems.
