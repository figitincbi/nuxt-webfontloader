# Instrumental Methods of Chemical Analysis by Chatwal: A Review
 
Instrumental methods of chemical analysis are techniques that use instruments to measure the physical or chemical properties of a sample. These methods can provide information on the composition, structure, purity, and quality of a substance. Instrumental methods of chemical analysis are widely used in various fields such as environmental science, pharmaceutical science, forensic science, material science, and biochemistry.

One of the books that covers the principles and applications of instrumental methods of chemical analysis is *Instrumental Methods of Chemical Analysis* by Gurdeep R. Chatwal and Sham K. Anand[^1^]. This book was first published in 1979 by Himalaya Publishing House and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition was published in 2016 and contains 34 chapters that cover topics such as spectroscopy, chromatography, electrochemistry, thermal methods, radiochemical methods, and automated methods of analysis.
 
The book is intended for undergraduate and postgraduate students of chemistry, pharmacy, and related disciplines. It provides a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the theoretical and practical aspects of instrumental methods of chemical analysis. The book also includes numerous examples, illustrations, tables, figures, and exercises to help the readers understand the concepts and applications of the methods. The book also contains references to relevant literature and websites for further reading.
 
The book is available in both print and electronic formats. However, some users may be looking for a free PDF version of the book online. While there are some websites that claim to offer a free download of the book in PDF format[^2^] [^3^], these may not be reliable or legal sources. Moreover, some of these files may be corrupted or infected with malware. Therefore, it is advisable to purchase the book from a reputable source or access it through a library or an academic institution.
 
In conclusion, *Instrumental Methods of Chemical Analysis* by Chatwal and Anand is a useful and informative book for students and professionals who want to learn about the principles and applications of instrumental methods of chemical analysis. The book covers a wide range of topics and provides clear explanations and examples. However, users should be careful when searching for a free PDF version of the book online and should avoid downloading files from untrustworthy sources.
  
- Ultraviolet/visible molecular absorption spectrometry: This method measures the amount of light absorbed by a sample at different wavelengths in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This method can be used to identify and quantify organic and inorganic compounds based on their characteristic absorption spectra.
- Atomic absorption and atomic emission spectrometry: These methods measure the amount of light absorbed or emitted by atoms in a sample. These methods can be used to determine the concentration and identity of elements in a sample based on their characteristic atomic spectra.
- Mass spectrometry: This method measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions produced from a sample. This method can be used to determine the molecular weight, structure, and composition of organic and inorganic compounds based on their fragmentation patterns.
- Gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography: These methods separate the components of a mixture based on their different affinities for a stationary phase and a mobile phase. These methods can be used to separate, identify, and quantify complex mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds based on their retention times and peak areas.
- Potentiometry and voltammetry: These methods measure the electrical potential or current of a sample in relation to a reference electrode. These methods can be used to determine the concentration and identity of ions or molecules in a sample based on their electrochemical behavior.
